# callgrind to NewRelic

There are many profiling tools which write its output information in the `Valgrind callgrind` file format.
This tool is to send that information to `New Relic`.

The context-free grammatical rules in the `callgrind` language are formalized here:

         http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-format.html#cl-format.reference.grammar

The `callgrind` files can be generated by `Valgrind`'s `callgrind` tool (either without program instrumentation or with exact instrumentation of certain sections of code:

         http://www.mantidproject.org/Profiling_With_Valgrind#Profile_Selected_Portions_of_the_Code
), by `PHP`'s `xdebug` profiler:

         http://www.xdebug.org/docs/profiler

the `pprofile` profiler for `Python`:

         https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pprofile/
         
and other profilers like the `cpuprofile` in the `gperftools` suite:

         http://gperftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/cpuprofile.html

Of course, all these programs can be instrumented with `New Relic` itself ( https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents ), which has a different logic (more transactional with embeddable sub-segments inside transactions, with the code determining which custom metrics and attributes to collect, name, and send to New Relic, etc).
